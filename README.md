# Search_Engine_Project

A simple Crawler-based search engine that demonstrates the main features of a search engine (web crawling, indexing) and the interaction between them.

**Running the indexer and crawler**
- fill in the seeds.txt file with the desired initial links
- run the Main.java (SearchEngine/src/Engine/Main.java) to start the process
- to change the DB connection, go to the Constants.java(SearchEngine/src/Engine/Constants.java) file and change the password and username


**How to run the interface**
- install Python Compiler
- enter the Interface directory
- make sure that the requirements.txt exists 
- open a new cmd and enter $ pip install -r requirements.txt
- run $ python app.py

#### The app will be available on "localhost:5000"
